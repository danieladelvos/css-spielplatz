      Practice with Pseudo-Classes
    </h1>
    <p>
      Pseudo-classes are a way to select HTML elements based on their state as opposed to their HTML structure. You can read more about pseudo-classes here.

      Pseudo-classes must always be applied to an existing selector. Their "flag character" is the colon (":"), as you can see used in the below examples. Here are some of the most popular pseudo-classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      your name: <input />
      <button>
        enter
      </button>
    </p>
    <p>
      These pseudo classes are the ones you are probably most familiar with. Even on this page you've probably noticed that links have different style than paragraph text. The a tag by default sets the text color to blue with an underline, but have you ever seen a purple link? This is the "visited" pseudo-class that applies a different style to links that the user has already clicked. The opposite of visited is "link" which is a link a user has not yet clicked. These two states are mutually exclusive, meaning a link cannot be both at the same time.

      <li>The hover pseudo-class is applied when the user points at an object but doesn't activate it</li>
      <li>Most commonly when they let their mouse cursor lay on top of an element without clicking</li>
      <li>Some form factors don't support this, such as touch devices or pen surfaces</li>
    </ol>

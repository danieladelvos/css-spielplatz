      Practice with Pseudo-Classes
    </h1>
    <p>
      Pseudo-classes are a way to select HTML elements based on their state as opposed to their HTML structure. You can read more about pseudo-classes here.

      Pseudo-classes must always be applied to an existing selector. Their "flag character" is the colon (":"), as you can see used in the below examples. Here are some of the most popular pseudo-classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      your name: <input />
      <button>
        enter
      </button>
    </p>

    <p>
      These pseudo classes are the ones you are probably most familiar with. Even on this page you've probably noticed that links have different style than paragraph text. The a tag by default sets the text color to blue with an underline, but have you ever seen a purple link? This is the "visited" pseudo-class that applies a different style to links that the user has already clicked. The opposite of visited is "link" which is a link a user has not yet clicked. These two states are mutually exclusive, meaning a link cannot be both at the same time.

    <ol>
      <li>The hover pseudo-class is applied when the user points at an object but doesn't activate it</li>
      <li>Most commonly when they let their mouse cursor lay on top of an element without clicking</li>
      <li>Some form factors don't support this, such as touch devices or pen surfaces</li>
    </ol>

        Contextual Selectors
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you use two selectors separated by a space on a rule, you scope the rule to the elements that correspond to the selector on the right that are INSIDE the elements that correspond to the selector on the left. Let's say we have the following HTML:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Section 1
        </li>
        <li>
          Section 2
        </li>
      </ol>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h1>
        Section 1
      </h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Item 1
        </li>
        <li>
          Item 2
          <ol>
            <li>
              Subitem 1
            </li>
            <li>
              Subitem 2
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Item 3
        </li>
      </ol>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>

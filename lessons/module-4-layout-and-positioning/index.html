      If your elements are still not exactly where you want them to be after adjusting the padding, margins and alignment, then you can try out the float property. The "float" property is one of the most powerful tools you can master when learning CSS.
    </div>
    <div class="topLeft">
      Up until now, we haven't moved elements very far from wherever the web browser automatically places them, but as you've probably noticed this has left our page very left side heavy.
    </div>
    <div class="bottomRight">
      The float property liberates an element from its automatic position and lifts it up to "float" on top of other elements in the direction you specify.  You can specify float either right, left or the default of none.
    </div>
    <div class="bottomLeft">
      Elements underneath a floating object will automatically wrap themselves around the content. For example, if you float an image, the text underneath will wrap around it so that none of it is actually obscured underneath the image.
